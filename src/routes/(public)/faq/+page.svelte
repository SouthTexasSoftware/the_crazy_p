	<Card
		question={"I WANT A CRAZY P LID BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT ON IT."}

	<Card
		question={'DO YOU DO WEDDING HATS?'}
		answer={'Yes! Creating a custom hat for your wedding day is one of my favorite pieces to see come together. Many brides like to have their new last name and wedding date burned,  and incorporate wedding colors in the band details. I love seeing your floral inspirations and incorporating them into a one of a kind lid. My turn around time does vary throughout the year, so please let me know sooner than later.'}
